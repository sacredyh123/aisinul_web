# ****AI Agent Simulation Web App Development Plan****

## **Overview**

The AI Agent Simulation Web App is a 2D role-playing game that simulates real-world working and collaboration environments. Users take on the role of a small character and interact with AI agents representing human employees in a laboratory or office setting. The primary objective is to monitor agent behavior and evaluate their performance, especially when they collaborate, in order to understand the potential of AI agents in real-world workplace settings.

## **Objectives**

1. Create an interactive web application that simulates real-world working and collaboration scenarios.
2. Enable users to monitor AI agent behavior and performance during collaborative tasks.
3. Showcase the potential of AI agents in real-world workplace settings and foster understanding of AI capabilities.
4. Enhance user engagement through dynamic scenarios, agent performance analytics, training, real-time collaboration tools, agent personality, user-defined goals, and gamification elements.

## **AI Agent Simulation Web App Structure**

1. **Backend (User Authentication and Docker/Kubernetes Management)**
    - Technology: Python with FastAPI (or any preferred backend technology)
    - Features:
        - User login, signup, and password recovery
        - User session management
        - Docker container management (start, stop, monitor)
        - Kubernetes integration for deploying, scaling, and updating Docker containers
    - Database: Neo4j for storing user data (email, password, unique name)
2. **Frontend (User Interface)**
    - Technology: React (or any preferred frontend technology)
    - Features:
        - Landing page with an explanation of the project, documentation, and login/signup buttons
        - Login page with fields for email and password, as well as buttons for signup and password recovery
        - Game environment (once logged in)
3. **Game Environment (Docker Container)**
    - Technology: Phaser for game development
    - Features:
        - AI agent simulation within a laboratory or office setting
        - User-controlled character to interact with AI agents and monitor their behavior
        - AI agents with various roles and abilities, working autonomously towards a main goal set by the user
        - Taskboard for user interaction and setting/modifying subtasks or main goals
        - AI agent collaboration based on abilities, roles, and location
        - Regular meetings with user interaction and progress sharing among agents
4. **Kubernetes Configuration**
    - AML files for deploying and managing Docker containers

## 

## **Technologies**

- Backend: FastAPI (Python)
- Frontend: Vue.js
- Game Engine: Mixi
- Database: Neo4j
- Containerization: Docker
- Orchestration: Kubernetes

## **Timeline**

**Step 1: Set up the backend for user authentication (1-2 weeks)**

1. Create a new FastAPI project.
2. Set up the Neo4j database for storing user data, including emails, passwords, and unique names.
3. Implement the login, signup, and password recovery features in your FastAPI application.

**Step 2: Create a simple frontend for user authentication (1-2 weeks)**

1. Create a new Vue.js project.
2. Design and implement a simple login page with fields for email and password, as well as buttons for signup and password recovery.
3. Connect the Vue.js frontend to the FastAPI backend to enable user authentication.

**Step 3: Set up Docker and Kubernetes management features (2-3 weeks)**

1. Install Docker on your development machine.
2. Create a Dockerfile for your game environment, which includes the Mixi game engine and other required dependencies.
3. Build a Docker image for the game environment.
4. Implement basic Docker management features in your FastAPI application, such as starting, stopping, and monitoring Docker containers.
5. Install Kubernetes on your development machine.
6. Create Kubernetes configurations (e.g., YAML files) for deploying and managing Docker containers.
7. Implement Kubernetes management features in your FastAPI application, such as deploying, scaling, and updating Docker containers.

**Step 4: Develop the game environment (4-6 weeks)**

1. Create a new Mixi project for the game environment.
2. Design and implement the laboratory or office setting for the game.
3. Develop the user-controlled character with basic movement and interaction abilities.
4. Implement the AI agents with various roles and abilities, working autonomously towards a main goal set by the user.
5. Create the taskboard for user interaction and setting/modifying subtasks or main goals.
6. Develop AI agent collaboration based on abilities, roles, and location.
7. Implement regular meetings with user interaction and progress sharing among agents.

**Step 5: Integrate Docker with Kubernetes (2-3 weeks)**

1. Install Kubernetes on your development machine.
2. Create Kubernetes configurations (e.g., YAML files) for deploying and managing Docker containers.
3. Implement Kubernetes management features in your FastAPI application, such as deploying, scaling, and updating Docker containers.

**Step 6: Integrate the game environment with the frontend and backend (1-2 weeks)**

1. Update the Vue.js frontend to display the game environment after a user logs in.
2. Connect the game environment to the FastAPI backend to send and receive data related to AI agents, tasks, and user interactions.

**Step 7: Testing and bug fixing (2-4 weeks)**

1. Perform thorough testing of the entire application, including the Vue.js frontend, FastAPI backend, Mixi game environment, and Docker/Kubernetes integration.
2. Identify and fix any bugs or issues that arise during testing.
3. Optimize the game for performance and usability.
